For a software to have observability, you must be able to do the following.

- Understand the inner workings of your application.
- Understand any system state your application may have gotten itself into, even new ones you have never seen before and couldn’t have predicted.
- Understand the inner workings and system state solely by observing and interrogating with external tools.
- Understand the internal state without shipping any new custom code to handle it (because that implies you needed prior knowledge to explain it)
