Think about how large scale software is built. The massive scope and complexity. How we reason and make sense of these large projects, is to use modules.

Modules are defined as:
 
 > A standardized, often interchangeable component of a system or construction that is designed for easy assembly or flexible use. 
 
How do we build these modules in isolation? 

How do we reason about and design our modules?
