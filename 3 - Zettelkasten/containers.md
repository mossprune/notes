Containers bring many advantages: as described in Docker’s original tagline, they
allow you to “build once, run anywhere.” They do this by bundling together an appli‐
cation and all its dependencies and isolating the application from the rest of the
machine it’s running on. The containerized application has everything it needs, and it
is easy to package up as a container image that will run the same on my laptop and
yours, in the cloud, or on a server in a data center.
