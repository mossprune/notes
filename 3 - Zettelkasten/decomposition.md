The process of breaking down a large, complex problem or system into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.

The ability to break down a complex system into [[module]]'s is enhanced by a primary cognitive skill: the capacity to distinguish between the [[abstraction]] and the [[implementation]] of each part.

> [!Important] 
> The most important rule in system engineering: when using any [[module]] you should only focus on its [[abstraction]] and ignore its [[implementation]] completely. This type of thinking allows us to reduce cognitive load and work in manageable chunks.

These [[abstraction]]'s are built layer by layer, resulting in higher level functionality.
