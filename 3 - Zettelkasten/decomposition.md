> [!Important] 
> The most important rule in system engineering: when using any [[module]] you should only focus on its [[abstraction]] and ignore its [[implementation]] completely. This type of thinking allows us to reduce cognitive load and work in manageable chunks.

These [[abstraction]]'s are built layer by layer, resulting in higher level functionality.
