Good modular design should allow you to work individual modules independently, while completely ignoring the rest of the system. Great modular design allows you to build the modules in any order and parallel. 

[[modular-design]] also easily leads to [[decomposition]]


The ability to break down a complex system into [[module]]'s is enhanced by a primary cognitive skill: the capacity to distinguish between the [[abstraction]] and the [[implementation]] of each part.

> [!Important] 
> The most important rule in system engineering: when using any [[module]] you should only focus on its [[abstraction]] and ignore its [[implementation]] completely. This type of thinking allows us to reduce cognitive load and work in manageable chunks.

These [[abstraction]]'s are built layer by layer, resulting in higher level functionality.
