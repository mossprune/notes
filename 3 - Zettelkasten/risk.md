A risk is a potential problem and the effects that the problem occurring will cause.


Risks vary greatly from one organization to another. For a bank holding money on
behalf of customers, the biggest risk is almost certainly of money being stolen. An
e-commerce organization will worry about the risks of fraudulent transactions. An
individual running a personal blog site might fear someone breaking in to impersonate them and post inappropriate comments.

Because the risks vary greatly, the relative importance of different threats will also
vary, as will the appropriate set of mitigations. A risk management framework is a
process for thinking about risks in a systematic way, enumerating the possible threats,
prioritizing their importance, and defining an approach to mitigation
