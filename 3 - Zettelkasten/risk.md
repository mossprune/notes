A risk is a potential problem and the effects that the problem occurring will cause.


Risks vary greatly from one organization to another. For a bank holding money on
behalf of customers, the biggest risk is almost certainly of money being stolen. An
ecommerce organization will worry about the risks of fraudulent transactions. An
individual running a personal blog site might fear someone breaking in to imperso‐
nate them and post inappropriate comments. Because privacy regulations differ
between nations, the risk of leaking customers’ personal data varies with geography—
in some countries, the risk is “only” reputational, while in Europe, the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) allows for fines of up to 4% of a company’s total
revenue.
